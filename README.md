# Shortest Path Algorithum

## Why?
I was very intruiged with the way Google Maps was able to calculate the shortest path to a destination and wanted to create my own version for solving the problem.

This program is an attempt to find the shortest path using Java to visualize nodes and possible paths that can be traveled. I made this during my sophomore year in college where I double majored in Computer Science and Computer Engineering so I at the time during the making of this project I haven't taken Data Structures or Algorithms classes.
